# EDAN-Search-Console-Drupal-

The Search Console provides multiple ways to query EDAN and view results. It can be used as a developement tool or playground to learn how EDAN functions.
 
* Search Field Filters
* URL
* Raw Query
 
You may use any of these options to query EDAN, although only the visible section will be used to query results.
For example, if you fill out the collections URL section and tab over to the raw query section, only the raw query section will be submitted!
A detailed description of each query option can be found on the wiki.
